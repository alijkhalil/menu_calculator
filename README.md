# menu_calculator
Java project providing a GUI for restaurant owners to calculate exact cost of items/dishes on their menus (using the dishes' recipes).

The source is quite old and has some of the logic commented out (like the password checker).  However, it should be mostly bug free and capable of being built with any Java compiler.   

As for the actual executable, this is excellent tool to get a sense of margins, food costs, and wastage in developing a restaruant menu.

In the 'final_deliverables' directory, you will find an executable jar, example menu, and usage manual.  Collectively, they should be enough to get anyone started with the program.

Enjoy!
